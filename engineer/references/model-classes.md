# Model classes — which *class* of model runs which part of the pipeline

Every dispatched agent picks a model. The default — inherit the parent's — is
right for the pipeline proper and wrong at both ends of it: mechanical work a
cheaper model does identically, and bounded one-shot judgment calls worth the
top tier.

**This file names classes, never products.** Model names churn — families are
retired, new ones appear above the old ceiling, and a name pinned into a skill
becomes a silent bug the day it is deprecated. Skills refer to `economy`,
`inherit`, and `frontier`; the mapping to whatever exists today is resolved at
dispatch time, in one place: the rule below.

("Class", not "tier" — `parallelism.md` already uses *tier* for the
parallelism substrate (1/2/3). Two axes, two words.)

## The three classes

| Class | Means | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| **`economy`** | the cheapest tier that reliably executes a deterministic rubric | `atdd:spec-guardian`, `atdd:pipeline-builder`, `Explore`/search fan-outs, `consistency-check --project` per-feature fan-out, `progress-log`, `arch-check`, `post-merge`, any step whose real work is running a `dae_*` script and reporting its output |
| **`inherit`** *(default)* | whatever the session is already running | `discover-acs`, `plan`, CP5 implement, `refine`, `fix`, `discuss`, the review **advocate**. The pipeline proper — where judgment lives and the tokens are earned. Do not economize here. |
| **`frontier`** | the highest-capability tier available, whatever it currently is | Bounded one-shot judgment: the review **adviser** at CP2/CP4, a CP7 independent verdict. Only economical when the read set is *listed in the brief* and the agent returns a verdict rather than iterating. |

There is deliberately no fourth "cheapest possible" class. The smallest models
carry materially smaller context windows, and DAE agents routinely load
`feature.md` + `acs.md` + `spec.md` + `plan.md` + `CHARTER.md` plus source. A
class that silently truncates the contract is worse than no class.

## Resolving a class to an actual model

**At dispatch time, read the `model` enum on the Agent tool you are about to
call and pick from it.** That enum is supplied by the harness and is current by
construction — it is the only model list in the system that cannot go stale.

- `economy` → the smallest alias in the enum whose context window still fits the
  brief's read set. In practice the mid-tier alias, not the smallest one.
- `inherit` → omit the `model` field entirely. Never name the parent's model:
  the point is to follow it when it changes.
- `frontier` → the alias the enum documents as most capable. When two are
  equally capable, prefer the cheaper.

If the enum offers only one option, every class resolves to it and the
distinction costs nothing. If a class's intent cannot be honoured, dispatch
anyway with the closest available option — a model choice is never worth
blocking a checkpoint over.

### Dated snapshot — a hint, not the contract

As of **2026-07-29** the aliases were `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, `fable`, and
the classes resolved to `sonnet` / *(omit)* / `fable`. Recorded so a reader can
sanity-check the rule against a known-good example. **Do not treat this line as
authoritative** — resolve from the live enum, and if it disagrees with this
snapshot, the enum is right and this line is stale.

## Picking a class

Ask, in order:

1. **Is the charge mechanical?** A fixed rubric, a schema check, codegen from an
   IR, a search-and-report, a script wrapper → `economy`.
2. **Is it a bounded one-shot judgment call?** The agent reads a listed set of
   files exactly once and returns an opinion, with no build/edit/iterate loop
   → `frontier`.
3. **Otherwise** → `inherit`. Multi-turn work, anything that edits files,
   anything whose read set is discovered as it goes.

Decide this **per dispatch, from the actual charge** — the same way parallelism
is discovered per run. `refine` over a 2-file change is mechanical; `refine`
across 40 files with a charter-conformance argument is not. Never hardcode a
class into a skill either.

## Why the classes are shaped this way

A cost observation from 21 DAE sessions (2026-07-10 → 07-29). The specific
numbers date quickly; the *shape* is what the classes encode:

- **98% of input tokens were cache reads.** Prompt length is not the cost lever.
  The per-model input rate still dominates a long run, because cache reads bill
  as a fraction of it — so *which class carries the long-context loop* is the
  decision that matters.
- The top class took **23% of spend for 4% of the output** — it read a great deal
  and wrote very little. That is the correct shape for a one-shot adviser and
  the wrong shape for anything that loops. **Never put `frontier` in an agentic
  harness.**
- **101 of 157 subagent dispatches inherited the session model**, including
  purely mechanical ones. That is where the count is, and why `economy` exists.

## Interaction with prompt caching

Switching models mid-conversation invalidates the cache — caches are
model-scoped. That is an argument *for* pushing cheap work into a **subagent**
rather than switching the main loop's model: the subagent pays its own cold
write, and the parent's cached prefix survives untouched.
