# feature-init

Create a feature folder for the DAE pipeline — `feature.md` (the Ready contract), the folder, a branch, and a tracker entry. Checkpoint 1.5.

## When to use

Three paths:
- **From `discuss`** — receives a `feature_intake` payload in context (park or promote outcome). No interview.
- **Standalone** — no payload; run the intake interview.
- **Onboarding intake** — invoked by `onboard` (or directly) to formalize work that *already exists* in the codebase. The feature folder is reverse-engineered from an existing spec / branch / implementation. Enters at `status: in-progress` or `done`, not `ready`.

Detect from-discuss vs standalone by whether a `feature_intake` payload is present; onboarding intake is signalled by `onboard` (or an explicit "formalize existing feature" request).

**Not for:** brand-new ideas worth exploring first (`discuss`), or editing an existing feature (`feature-edit`).

## Workflow

1. **Resolve** — find `.engineer/manifest.yml`; resolve `methodology_root`. No manifest → point to `/engineer.onboard`.
2. **Gather intake** — from-discuss: read the payload. Standalone: interview — required fields one per turn (`title`, `slug`, `outcome`, `source_links`, `status`, `autonomy_level` if `status` is `ready`/`in-progress`/`done`, `scope`), optional fields (`target`, `owner`, `area`, `relevant_adrs`, `tags`, `size`) bundled at the end. Onboarding intake: reverse-engineer the fields from the existing spec / branch / commits; set `status` to `in-progress` or `done` per how complete the work is.
3. **Validate** — slug format (kebab-case, lowercase, ASCII, ≤50, leading letter); `autonomy_level` ∈ `manifest.autonomy.allowed_levels` and within path overrides; any `status` other than `parked` requires `autonomy_level`; `relevant_adrs` exist. Slug collision: if existing feature is `parked` → offer promote-from-parked (flip status, keep handoffs); if `ready`/`in-progress` → redirect to `feature-edit`; if `done` → reject.
4. **Decomposition check** — if scope spans multiple competencies or sounds like several PRs, surface it; user proceeds as one feature or re-invokes per sub-feature with `parent_feature` set.
5. **Allocate number** — scan `features/` for max `NNN`, +1, 3-digit zero-padded. (Parallel runs may race — solo work won't hit it.) **Onboarding intake exception:** inherit the existing number — a feature migrated from a Speckit `specs/NNN-slug/` keeps its `NNN`; do not renumber.
6. **Create** — `features/NNN-<slug>/` with `feature.md` (per the Foundation Design feature.md schema), empty `handoffs/`, empty `.build/`. Add `.build/` to `.gitignore`. Do NOT create `progress.md`/`acs.md`/`spec.md`/`plan.md`/`session-log.md` — downstream skills produce those.
7. **Branch** — auto-create `git checkout -b <slug>` unless `CHARTER.md` declares a manual git policy. **If the branch already exists** (common in onboarding intake — the feature's work is already on a branch) → use it, don't recreate.
8. **Tracker** — upsert a `TrackedFeature` via the driver (`local` mode = no-op); write the returned ref to `feature.md` `tracker_ref`.
9. **Handoff** — emit a summary.

## Handoff

Emit per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/handoff-summary.md`. `checkpoint: 1.5`; `recommended_next`: ready → "/engineer.prime-context then /engineer.discover-acs"; parked → "resume via /engineer.discuss <slug>"; onboarding intake → "/engineer.discover-acs (reverse-engineer mode)".

If folder + `feature.md` succeed but branch or tracker fails, emit `status: interrupted` noting what's incomplete.
