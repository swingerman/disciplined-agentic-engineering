"""dae_ontology.py — deterministic constraint checks over DAE's artifact graph.

DAE already has an ontology: entities (Feature, AC, SpecScenario, Handoff,
Checkpoint, RoadmapItem), relations between them (`covers`, `parent_feature`,
`verifies`), and constraints on both. Until now it lived as an English rule
table in the `consistency-check` skill and was evaluated by an LLM reading
prose — which meant it ran when someone remembered to ask.

This script is the ledger position: the mechanical rows of that table, executed
against the artifacts on disk, cheaply enough to run at every checkpoint exit.
The judgment rows ("are these ACs in domain language?", "do they cover the
outcome?") stay with the skill — they are not mechanical and this script does
not pretend otherwise.

Constraint vocabulary is borrowed from OWL because naming a check precisely is
most of the value — it makes the *missing* checks obvious:

  enumeration  a property's value must come from a fixed set
  functional   at most one holder of a value ("exactly one father")
  inverse      two properties must agree in both directions
  transitive   a relation that chains, and therefore must not cycle
  disjoint     two roles that must not be filled by the same individual
  closure      every X must be reachable from some Y (coverage)

Read-only. Never mutates an artifact.

Usage:
  dae_ontology.py <feature-dir>         check one feature
  dae_ontology.py --project [START_DIR] check project-wide invariants
  dae_ontology.py ... --json            machine-readable findings

Exit codes:
  0  no error-severity findings (warnings may be present)
  1  at least one error-severity finding
  2  bad usage / target not found
